WICKED AI 2.2.0
==============

Since I really like (read love) the Wicked AI missions and support for them has gone in the latest patches, I decided to dust off the old files and start making these 1.0.5+ compatible. Starting with a few minor bugfixes and some custom loadouts, but quickly turning into a proper redo with awesome help of the - very much alive - mod community!

### Release 2.2.0
- Multiple mission support
- Automatic ammo finder (no need to specify ammo in weaponarray - config.sqf)
- Option: Locked vehicles with keys randomly on AI
- Option: Friendly AI
- Added: Bandit Patrol mission
- [And much more](https://github.com/f3cuk/WICKED-AI/blob/master/changelist.md)

### Upcoming in 2.3.0+
- More missions
- Further enhancements
