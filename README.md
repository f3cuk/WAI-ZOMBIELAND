WICKED AI for Arma 3 Epoch (1.0.0)
==============

Since I really like (read love) the Wicked AI missions and support for them has gone in the latest patches,
I decided to dust off the old files and start making these 1.0.5+ compatible. Starting with a few minor bugfixes and some custom loadouts,
but quickly turning into a proper redo with awesome help of the - very much alive - mod community!

### Release 1.0.0
- Basic missions
- Dynamic loot
- Multi mission support
- Better markers

### Upcoming in X.X.X+
